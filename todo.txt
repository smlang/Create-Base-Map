Hi

I've written a new tool for creating draft master maps for Night Street
events in OCAD9.

It can currently:
+ Download OpenStreetMap data
+ Import and convert OpenStreetMap data into OCAD objects
+ Import and convert OS 1:50,000 data into OCAD objects
+ Include objects from other Geo-referenced OCAD9 files
+ Download GeoTIFF images from Roadworks website
+ Add and position GeoTIFF images as background maps
(Unfortunately, download of OS data and OS images cannot be automated).

If you know anyone who is about to start a mapping project, I can
provide them either with the tool, or with a draft map generated by the
tool.

I plan to:
+ Add bridges and tunnels objects, parallel to roads/paths/waterways
+ Join objects of the same type where both end at the same point
+ Add dash points, where two objects form a junction/crossing
+ Identify and remove duplicate objects
+ Enhance conversion of OSM and OS data to work with not just MDOC
Street Symbol set
+ Import and convert ESRI Sharp data into OCAD objects

Regards,
Steve
